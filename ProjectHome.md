## Description ##
My personal collection of random code that has made my life easier.  Open sourcing it in hopes of making someone else's life easier.

It goes without saying a lot of this crap is rough around the edges, has poor error checking, doesn't work in all situations, will eat your children, etc.

Use at your own peril :)
